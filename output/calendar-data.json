        "description": "## Resolution Criteria\nThis market resolves to the bucket containing the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) of the official Backpack token 24 hours after its Token Generation Event (TGE). If the valuation falls exactly on a boundary, the resolution falls into the higher bucket.\n###\n**FDV Calculation Hierarchy:** \n1. Displayed FDV on the Primary Source. \n2. If unavailable, calculated as (Price × Max Supply). Max Supply is the hard cap defined in the smart contract/documentation. \n3. If unavailable, calculated as (Price × Total Supply). Total Supply is minted tokens minus burned tokens. \n###\n**Token Identification:** \n###\nMust be the official native utility or governance token of the Backpack ecosystem. If multiple tokens launch simultaneously (e.g., governance vs. utility), the market resolves based on the token with the higher FDV. If only one is tradeable on the Primary Source, that token is used. \n###\n**TGE Definition:**\n###\nThe first moment the token is available for public trading with **meaningful liquidity** (>$50,000 USD in a DEX pool or open order books on a CEX). Mere on-chain transferability does not count.\n\n## Resolution Sources\nPrimary Resolution Source: [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/)\n\nSecondary Resolution Source: [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n## Additional Information\n**Listing Delays:** \n*   If CoinGecko has not listed the token within 48 hours of TGE, CoinMarketCap becomes the Primary Source.\n*   If **neither** source has listed the token within 72 hours of TGE, resolution uses price data from the DEX/CEX with the highest verified volume combined with the Max Supply definition. \n\n**Data Discrepancies:** If FDV is ≤$0, or if the Primary Source differs from the Secondary Source by >500%, the Secondary Source is used.\n\n**TGE on Deadline:** If TGE occurs on December 31, 2026, settlement is delayed 24 hours to allow for resolution. If TGE has not occurred by December 31, 2026, at 11:59:59 PM UTC, the market resolves to \"No Token Launch\". \n\n**Airdrops:** Non-transferable points or locked tokens do not constitute a TGE; the token must be tradeable on a secondary market. \n\n**Initial Non-Transferability:** If a token is generated but remains non-transferable (locked) beyond December 31, 2026, it resolves to **\"No Token Launch\"**.\n\n**Currency:** All values are resolved in USD.",

If no official closing price is published, the next trading day with an official closing price will be treated as the first trading day.\n###\nIf market capitalisations are equal, the market will resolve to the ticker that comes first in case-insensitive alphabetical order, using standard ASCII ordering.\n### Timing and Announcement\nA ticker symbol is considered valid only if it is:\n- publicly confirmed by SpaceX or the primary listing exchange, and\n- associated with an actual public listing that results in trading commencing.\n### \nAnnouncements of a ticker symbol that are later withdrawn, revised, or not followed by a qualifying public listing do not trigger resolution.\n### Resolution to \"Other\"\nThis market will resolve to “Other” if:\n- SpaceX does not complete a qualifying public listing by the resolution deadline, or\n- SpaceX completes a qualifying public listing using a ticker symbol not explicitly listed as an outcome in this market.",

      "question": "Backpack market cap (FDV) one day after TGE? [start: LAUNCH DAY]",
      "description": "## Resolution Criteria\nThis market resolves to the bucket containing the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) of the official Backpack token 24 hours after its Token Generation Event (TGE). If the valuation falls exactly on a boundary, the resolution falls into the higher bucket.\n###\n**FDV Calculation Hierarchy:** \n1. Displayed FDV on the Primary Source. \n2. If unavailable, calculated as (Price × Max Supply). Max Supply is the hard cap defined in the smart contract/documentation. \n3. If unavailable, calculated as (Price × Total Supply). Total Supply is minted tokens minus burned tokens. \n###\n**Token Identification:** \n###\nMust be the official native utility or governance token of the Backpack ecosystem. If multiple tokens launch simultaneously (e.g., governance vs. utility), the market resolves based on the token with the higher FDV. If only one is tradeable on the Primary Source, that token is used. \n###\n**TGE Definition:**\n###\nThe first moment the token is available for public trading with **meaningful liquidity** (>$50,000 USD in a DEX pool or open order books on a CEX). Mere on-chain transferability does not count.\n\n## Resolution Sources\nPrimary Resolution Source: [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/)\n\nSecondary Resolution Source: [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)\n\n## Additional Information\n**Listing Delays:** \n*   If CoinGecko has not listed the token within 48 hours of TGE, CoinMarketCap becomes the Primary Source.\n*   If **neither** source has listed the token within 72 hours of TGE, resolution uses price data from the DEX/CEX with the highest verified volume combined with the Max Supply definition. \n\n**Data Discrepancies:** If FDV is ≤$0, or if the Primary Source differs from the Secondary Source by >500%, the Secondary Source is used.\n\n**TGE on Deadline:** If TGE occurs on December 31, 2026, settlement is delayed 24 hours to allow for resolution. If TGE has not occurred by December 31, 2026, at 11:59:59 PM UTC, the market resolves to \"No Token Launch\". \n\n**Airdrops:** Non-transferable points or locked tokens do not constitute a TGE; the token must be tradeable on a secondary market. \n\n**Initial Non-Transferability:** If a token is generated but remains non-transferable (locked) beyond December 31, 2026, it resolves to **\"No Token Launch\"**.\n\n**Currency:** All values are resolved in USD.",
